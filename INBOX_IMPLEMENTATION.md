# Inbox Functionality Implementation

## Overview
The inbox functionality has been implemented to provide users with a centralized location to view and manage various types of notifications and messages, similar to Discord's inbox system.

## Features

### 1. Inbox Types
- **Direct Messages**: Private conversations between users
- **Mentions**: When users are mentioned in messages using @username
- **Server Invites**: Invitations to join servers
- **Friend Requests**: Friend connection requests
- **System Notifications**: Platform-wide announcements and updates
- **Server Updates**: Changes and updates to servers the user is part of

### 2. Core Components

#### InboxModalComponent
- Main modal interface for viewing inbox items
- Tabbed navigation (All, Unread, Mentions, Direct Messages)
- Search functionality
- Advanced filtering options
- Mark as read/unread functionality
- Delete items

#### InboxService
- Manages inbox state and operations
- Handles CRUD operations for inbox items
- Provides real-time updates via observables
- Mock data for development/testing

#### NotificationBadgeComponent
- Reusable notification badge showing unread counts
- Configurable size, color, and maximum count display
- Animated for high notification counts

### 3. Backend API Endpoints

#### GET /api/inbox
- Retrieves all inbox items for the current user
- Supports filtering and pagination
- Returns items sorted by timestamp (newest first)

#### PUT /api/inbox/{itemId}/read
- Marks a specific inbox item as read
- Updates the read status in the database

#### DELETE /api/inbox/{itemId}
- Removes an inbox item
- Permanently deletes the item from the user's inbox

## Usage

### Opening the Inbox
1. Click the inbox button in the sidebar (envelope icon)
2. The inbox modal will open showing all items
3. Use tabs to filter by type
4. Use search to find specific items
5. Use filters panel for advanced filtering

### Managing Items
- **Mark as Read**: Click the checkmark icon on unread items
- **Mark All Read**: Use the "Mark All Read" button
- **Delete**: Click the trash icon to remove items
- **Filter**: Use the filters panel to show/hide specific types

### Notification Badge
- Shows unread count on the inbox button
- Automatically updates when items are marked as read
- Displays "99+" for counts over 99

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Uses Angular signals for reactive state management
- BehaviorSubjects for real-time updates
- Computed values for derived state

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS for consistent design
- Discord-like color scheme and styling
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Smooth animations and transitions

### Data Flow
1. User interacts with inbox
2. Component calls service methods
3. Service updates local state
4. UI automatically updates via signals
5. Backend API calls for persistence

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Real-time notifications via WebSocket
- Push notifications for mobile
- Email notifications for important items
- Custom notification preferences
- Bulk actions (mark multiple as read, delete multiple)
- Export inbox data
- Integration with external notification services

### Backend Improvements
- Proper user authentication and authorization
- Database schema for inbox items
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Notification queuing system
- Analytics and reporting

## Development Notes

### Mock Data
Currently using mock data for development. To switch to real backend:
1. Update `InboxService` to use real API calls
2. Remove mock data loading
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Add loading states

### Testing
- Unit tests for service methods
- Component testing for UI interactions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for complete user flows

## Dependencies
- Angular 17+ with signals
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Moment.js for date handling
- RxJS for reactive programming
- PHP backend with Slim framework

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers with ES2020+ support
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Progressive Web App capabilities
